John Black\'s land later became the core of Virginia Tech\'s Campus. From 1798 until the mid-1900s tom\'s creek street which is now Main street was filled with stores, hotels, banks, and residences. The area to the southeast of the municipal building was full of white-fenced houses, cows, and orchards.',

Across from the municipal building, at the corner of Washington Street and Draper Road, the Five Chimneys house is an excellent example of an early residential structure. The house was built in 1852 by physician and merchant John R. Phillips. I featured five large rooms each with its own fireplace and chimney. The distinctive queen Anne porch was added thirty to fifty years after the original construction of the home. A VPI horticulture professor A.G. Smith made major changes to the home in the 1930s including reopening the fireplaces and enclosing the porch on the back of the home. Smith is also credited with the extensive landscaping that surrounds the property. There\'s a local legend that a prominent local lumber dealer and treasurer of the Blacksburg Presbyterian Church buried a large sum of money near the house sometime between 1892 and 1918. When the legend began circulating, many searched for the treasure but none has ever been found. Acquired by the town of Blacksburg in 1987, Five Chimneys now houses the Community Relations Office and WTOB channel 2: the town\'s community access television station.',

      title: 'B - Second Train Depot',
      description: 'Proceed to stop B. Blacksburg was never on a main railroad, but in 1854 Cambria became a stop on the Virginia/Tennessee railroad. A narrow, winding road led from Cambria to Blacksburg until 1904 when the railroad from Cambria to Blacksburg was built. This rail spur line was called the Huckleberry named for the abundance of native berries that grew along the tracks. The first depot in Blacksburg was a simple wooden structure located on the current site of the library. Notice that the architecture of the library is reminiscent of a train depot. The second depot was located on the site of the municipal building and served as the main entry point to the town for students and visitors for many years. Trains would arrive at this depot stopped to unload passengers and then the train would back up for the entire return trip to Cambria. When the university was built, power plants were needed to supply the area. The drop-off point of the coal for these plants was across Draper Road where a trestle allowed rail cars to drop coal onto trucks on the road below for delivery to the power plant on campus. The section of railroad between Blacksburg and what is now the New River Valley Mall in Christiansburg is a walking/biking path known as the Huckleberry Trail.',

In 2009, the town of Blacksburg rehabilitated the building for use as municipal office space and for town meetings. The architectural style is art deco and features terrazzo floors and tin ceilings. The building burned in 1933 but was quickly rebuilt with an addition to the original building.',

If you look down Church Street, you will notice that in either direction there are T intersections where the road ends. At one end, the old Blacksburg Middle School is visible. At the other end is Old Town Hall. Church Street is situated in the middle of the town and was possibly intended to be the main street of Blacksburg. In the 1800\'s, this street would have been a mix of residences, hotels, and stores  as well as college student housing. The southwestern end of Lee Street also ends at a T-intersection and again a building faces the intersection. There are nine examples of T-intersections within the original 16 blocks of the town, and many of them terminate at a building. Even Main Street used to end in a T-intersection. One of the first buildings on the university campus was built in the middle of what is now Main Street, and Main Street curved around the building. The road pattern can still be seen where College Avenue crosses Main Street. The highest point of Church Street is the site of the Methodist Church. The majority of Blacksburg\'s early population was Methodist and Presbyterian. Blacksburg\'s first Methodist Congregation was established in 1798. The earliest portion of this building was built in the early 1900s and has been added on to several times. The Methodist church has beautiful stained glass memorial windows, one of which was dedicated to Dr. Harvey Black-a grandson of John Black and great-nephew of William Black. Harvey Black was the regimental surgeon for the 4th regiment Stonewall Brigade during the Civil War and assisted surgeon McGuire in amputating Stonewall Jackson\'s arm after the battle of Chancellorsville. Harvey Black\'s house was located on the lot that is now Mellow Mushroom.',

Your tour will take you to the site of spout spring. The Tech bookstore parking lot located on South Main Street is located over the town spring. The town spring was closed down between 1890 and 1891 due to a typhoid fever outbreak. It was reopened when a livery stable uphill from the spring was removed.

Mr. Spickard needed a lot of water. He built his house close to spout spring, Blacksburg\'s main water supply. In the 1850s there were more than two dozen artisans in the town. All of these artisans would have relied on water for their livelihood and the water would have been transported from this spring. Notice the small log structure located behind the house. This was a meat house which cured meat with salt rather than the more prevalent smokehouse.',

But as the town grew, and the university was built, the demand for water increased. In the late 1930s, problems such as the typhoid outbreak and other diseases occurred, prompting the town of Blacksburg to join Christiansburg and Virginia Tech to form a water authority. The authority began to draw water from the New River in the early 1950s.',

The section of Main Street between Roanoke Street and College Avenue has many buildings that date to the late 1800s and has always been a main conduit of activity between the town and the university. There are many early photographs of this section of Main Street. The intersection of Main Street and College Avenue used to feature the alumni gate, which was the main entrance to the VPI campus. In the mid-1800s, many in the community thought there should be a boys school to complement the Blacksburg Female Academy. To fill that need, the Methodists bought about five acres of land for 650 dollars just southwest of the present entrance to the Virginia Tech Mall and they built a school built. The Olin and Preston Institute opened in 1851, but by 1858 the school was struggling financially. The property went to a creditor and remained open but was forced to close during the Civil War. In 1869 the Olin and Preston Institute reopened under the name Preston and Olin Institute. In 1872, to ease financial problems at the Preston and Olin Institute, the trustees asked Reverend Peter Wisner and Dr. Harvey Black to submit a proposal to the State General Assembly to use Virginia\'s share of federal grant money to open a college of agriculture and mechanical arts in Blacksburg. The University of Virginia and the College of William and Mary were not interested in the agricultural focus of the land-grant university, so they did not adequately compete for the funding. Blacksburg leaders gave up the Preston and Olin name, donated land to the college along with 20,000 dollars of county money, and thereby established a new college in Blacksburg called Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical. In 1896, after considerable growth, the name was changed to the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College and Polytechnic Institute. In 1944 it became Virginia Polytechnic Institute and finally, in 1970 it became the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.',
